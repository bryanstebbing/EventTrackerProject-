#Description
'Event Tracker' is a project focused on building a front end for an API that performs full CRUD operations in conjunction with a MySQl Database. The goal is to implement Angular functionality, configure the application, send asynchronous requests to the server, and build Create/Read/Update/Delete functionality on the client.

#Technologies Used
- Angular: Used to configure the front end of the application.
- Java: Backend implementation for the API with full CRUD operations.
- HTTP: Asynchronous requests are sent and received from the Java controller.
- JSON: Data is sent and received in JSON format.
- Spring Tool Suite (STS): Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.
- MySQL: Database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- Postman: API testing tool used to ensure proper API functionality.
- MAMP: Local server environment for MySQL, Apache, and PHP.
- VS Code: Code editor for Angular project development.
- Bootstrap: Optional for styling the project.

#Lessons Learned
The learning objectives of this project include configuring an Angular application, utilizing components, services, and directives, sending/receiving JSON data, and making asynchronous requests to a Java controller using HTTP. The approach is to understand each step thoroughly before moving on, addressing potential challenges in DOM manipulation, HTTP, promises, and JSON representation of objects. The project serves as an opportunity to struggle through difficulties and enhance understanding.
