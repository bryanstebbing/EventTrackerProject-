/*
1 : Invoke a function named 'greet', pass your name to the function as an
argument ...

***NOTE:*** At the moment, this will throw `ReferenceError: greet is not defined`
*/

/***********Your Solution************/
greet("Bryan");
/************************************/

/*
2 : Write a function **declaration** named 'greet' which takes one argument (name).

'greet' should return the string 'Hello {name}' where {name} is the name provided as an argument.
*/

/***********Your Solution************/
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello ${name}`;

/*
3 : Invoke a function named 'farewell'. Pass your name to the function as an
argument ...

***NOTE:*** This function will also throw `ReferenceError: farewell is not defined`
*/

/***********Your Solution************/
try{
farewell("Bryan");
}catch(e){}

/*
4 : Write a function **expression** named 'farewell', the assigned function
should take one argument ('name').

'farewell' should return the string 'Goodbye {name}' where {name} is the name
provided as an argument.

***NOTE:*** The correct solution to this exercise will produce a TypeError. It
is important that you understand why this error (instead of a `ReferenceError`)
is produced. With your pair think about how the JS interpreter is evaluating the
function expression and try to determine exactly what is happening. If you can
not discern why a TypeError has occured ask an instructor for help.

/***********Your Solution************/
var farewell = function(name) {
  return `Goodbye ${name}`;
};

/*
5 : Create a new function **expression** named 'sayHello', assign it the value
of the 'greet' function declaration.

Invoke 'sayHello' and pass it your name. What is the result?

***NOTE***: At first this code will be unreachable because of the unrecoverable
error encountered in your solution to #3. This is a fairly common problem in
JavaScript development, if the interpreter encounters an error in a chain of
function executions it will just stop executing the chain...making it seem as
though things just aren't working. Usually this results from a value being
`undefined` when it needed to be something else (e.g. a function). Surround that
answer in a `try/catch` in order to allow the interpreter to continue.

function greet(name) {

  var sayHello = greet;
